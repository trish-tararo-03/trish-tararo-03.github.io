      A discussion about the challenges this week, and different problem solving

      <h2 class="title">A frustration over function logic</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        This week has definitely been a lot more challenging than the previous
        weeks. For me, I think the simple problem that I struggled with was
        figuring out how to put together a function to gives the desired result.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        In the Superbuzz Kata, we needed to create a function that takes in a
        list of numbers. We then needed to perform a function we created
        previously on each number in the list, and return the newly created
        list. I am confident in my ability to research different methods, and I
        knew what each piece of the puzzle was, but I wasn’t sure how to put the
        puzzle together.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        I felt really frustrated with myself at first, because I thought that
        this should be really obvious, its only the second Kata! I had so many
        tabs open with w3schools tabs, trying to understand different methods.
        It wasn’t untill I watched the recorded video of Josephs explanations
        that the pieces clicked into place.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        I learned that you can access a specific number in the list using the
        [i] notation, and the save that in a variable, which you can then use to
        pass to your previously created function. My frustration equated to two
        lines of code. simple, yet complicated.
      </p>

      <p class="main-text">
        With my new found realizations from the previous Kata, we were presented
        with the Gradebook Kata. There was a function that we had to create that
        would calculate the average score from a list of numbers and return the
        result.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        This time, I used pseudocode, to write out what I did know. I knew how
        to calculate, the average, I knew how to access an item in the list, and
        I knew I had to return the end result. I then researched what I didn’t
        know, which was how to add an item from the list into a new list. I
        researched the addition assignment operator, and tried different
        combinations of my variables.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        A sigh of relief and a small fist pump to celebrate the word true
        popping up on my screen, indicating that the function had passed the
        test. I felt proud, that I had figured out to solve this problem on my
        own. I felt my confidence rise, piece by piece. Javascript is slowly
        becoming less terrifying to me.

      <h3 class="question">Pseudocode</h3>
      <p class="main-text">Logic structure doesn’t come easy to me so using pseudocode to write out the logic flow has been super helpful for me. I am able to organize my thoughts, and reverse engineer through writing pseudocode. </p>
      <h3 class="question">Trying something</h3>
      <p class="main-text">This is my default setting. Letting my hands throw some lines of code together and seeing what the results are.</p>
      <h3 class="question">Rubber ducky method</h3>
      <p class="main-text">I feel pretty confident about verbalizing my frustrations out to an imaginary duck. Would be nice if the duck replied with a usable answer!</p>
      <h3 class="question">Console.Logging</h3>
      <p class="main-text">I will be working to make this the default setting. This definitely helped me assess and understand what my code was doing during the Kata exercises.</p>
      <h3 class="question">Googling</h3>
      <p class="main-text">Google + W3Schools + Stack Overflow + MDN Docs = rookie developer default settings.</p>
      <h3 class="question">Asking your peers for help</h3>
      <p class="main-text">So far, I don’t have an issue with actually asking for help from fellow peers, I just don’t actually ask for the help directly. I’ve found a lot of answers to my questions through various threads related to the topic on discord.</p>
      <h3 class="question">Asking coaches for help</h3>
      <p class="main-text">The same as above, I don't have an issue with asking, just haven’t asked directly yet. I'm sure this will change come bootcamp.</p>
      <h3 class="question">Improving your process with reflection</h3>
      <p class="main-text">I really appreciate how writing reflections can help me assess my thoughts, progress and overall journey. I feel like with reflections I can assess what methods worked for me, what areas made me feel a little out of my comfort zone, and what parts I enjoyed.</p>
