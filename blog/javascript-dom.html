        Right now, JavaScript for me, feels like a series of pipes, where you
        know what each pipe is for, but it all links into one another, they
        bend, loop around corners, some come to a dead end, some are left
        open-ended… Dang .

        The Relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript
      </h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        Perhaps a simple analogy to describe this relationship is like planting
        a seed and encouraging it to grow?
      </p>
      <img src="/images/cacti-hybrid.jpg" alt="A Cacti in a gold tim container with lid" class="image">
      <p class="main-text">
        The seed, soil and planter pot would represent HTML - the structure and
        foundation. To encourage the plant to grow, we need water, food and
        light. These three processes would represent JavaScript, the
        functionalities required for any action to happen. And finally, when the
        seed blossoms in a beautiful cacti-hybrid with leaves equally spiky as
        they are purple(?) - This is the CSS. We can even re-pot the plant into
        an oddly shaped, stained glass window painted clay pot!

    <div class="section-card">
      <h2 class="title" id="control-flow">
        Control Flow and Loops - Using an example from everyday life
      </h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        Control flow is simply the order in which a computer will execute the
        statements, instructions or functions written. It is usually executed
        from top to bottom.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        A good example (That I really want to incorporate into my life) is going
        to the gym. The process may look something like this:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="bulletpoints">Pack your gym bag</li>
        <li class="bulletpoints">Head to the gym</li>
        <li class="bulletpoints">Workout</li>
        <li class="bulletpoints">Cooldown</li>
        <li class="bulletpoints">Leave the Gym</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="main-text">
        Generally, the process of going to the gym wouldn’t change. This would
        be considered the control flow.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        Where the flow could change however is during the actual workout. We
        could introduce a loop to dictate how many sets we do before we leave
        the gym. A loop is simple set of instructions that has some conditions.
        In this example, the condition is how many times we do a single set.
        Lets say we are working on our core. One set could look like:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="bulletpoints">Crunches x 20</li>
        <li class="bulletpoints">Hip Dips x 45sec</li>
        <li class="bulletpoints">Leg Raise x 45secs</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="main-text">The process would then look like:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="bulletpoints">Pack your gym bag</li>
        <li class="bulletpoints">Head to the gym</li>
        <li class="bulletpoints">
          Workout
          <ul class="list js">
            <li class="bulletpoints js">Do One Set of core exersizes</li>
            <li class="bulletpoints js">
              Question why you like pain while doing another set
            </li>
            <li class="bulletpoints js">Finish strong with One. More. Set!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="bulletpoints">Cooldown</li>
        <li class="bulletpoints">Leave the Gym</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="main-text">
        Using the loop, we decided to do three sets before we leave the gym. The
        loop would run through each set untill it has been fufilled, and we can
        say that we are one step closer to the defined six pack we all crave for
        summer!

      <h2 class="title" id="DOM">
        The one about the Document Object Model - DOM
      </h2>
      <p class="main-text">Lets start by breaking down each word of the DOM:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="bulletpoints js">Document - just the webpage.</li>
        <li class="bulletpoints js">
          Object - Every element within your document is an object.
        </li>
        <li class="bulletpoints js">
          Model - How each object in the document is displayed: tree style.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="question">What can we do?</h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        Imagine that you are a monkey named Jan, hanging out atop a Totara
        tree overlooking the beautiful landscape. You decide that you want climb
        down the tree towards a blue branch that has a couple bunches of yellow
        bananas growing on it. Like the handy monkey you are, you decide to
        change the color of one of the bunches to their natural color of green -
        They look more appetizing to you that way. You also feel the need to
        place a nametag on your bananas, so the other lemurs won’t steal them.
        You would naturally just climb down with ease and claim what’s yours
        right?!
      </p>

      <p class="main-text">
        It’s the same with the DOM. Using different methods or selectors, we can
        traverse the DOM to the specific element and interact with it,
        manipulate it to suit our needs.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">Lets take this a look at this example code:</p>

      <img src="/images/DOMExample-code.jpg" alt="code snippet" class="image-js" />
      <p class="main-text">
        This is what the code would look like in the browser:
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/DOMExample-browserView.jpg"
        alt="Browser view of code snippet"
        class="image-js"
      />
      <p class="main-text">
        Using a couple of methods, we can navigate through the tree, pick a
        bunch of bananas and claim it for ourselves!
      </p>

      <p class="main-text">
        We use the query selector to select the paragrapgh element using the id
        ‘jans-bananas’.<br />

        We can then manipulate the color of the bananas using the style property
        and adding the color value to change it to green.<br />

        We can also use the innerHTML property to stake our claim on the newly
        colored bananas!
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/DOMExample-browserViewAfter.jpg"
        alt="Text that describe a totara tree, with a blue branch, 2 bunches of yellow bananas and jans green bananas "
        class="image-js"
      />
      <p class="main-text">
        This is just a small taste of what is possible when we traverse the land
        of the DOM. The different selectors, methods, and properties we can
        manipulate are almost endless.

      <h2 class="title" id="arraysObj">
        Arrays vs Objects - and the difference in accessing properties
      </h2>
      <h3 class="question">What is an array?</h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        An array is a list that is used to group similar types of data. The
        variable or name attached to this would usually describe what the list
        is about. The items in the list is known as a value.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">An example of an array would look like this:</p>
      <img
        src="/images/fruits-array.jpg"
        alt="A code snippet about an array of fruits"
        class="image"
      />

      <h3 class="question">So an object is...?</h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        An object is also a list, but unlike an array, and object can hold
        different values within the collection. Each value will have a name
        attached to it. This is known as a name/value pair. Each name/value pair
        is known as a property of an object.
      </p>

      <p class="main-text">
        If we take the array example from above, this is what the apple would
        look like as an object:
      </p>

      <img
        src="/images/fruits-object.jpg"
        alt="A code snippet about an apple as an object"
        class="image-js"
      />
      <p class="main-text">
        Note that with an object, we can list values like an array, but we can
        also describe the object using the name/values pairs.
      </p>

      <h3 class="question">So the difference is...?</h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        To access values in an array we use the position of each value. This is
        know as the index value. Each value is assigned a an index number
        starting with 0. This is what that would look like:
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/array-index-position.jpg"
        alt="A code snippet describing an array of fruits and their index position"
        class="image"
      />
      <p class="main-text">
        We access the full array by referring to the name of the array. To
        access a single item in the array, we use the index position. Index
        position [1] would return “Oranges”.
      </p>

      <p class="main-text">
        To access a value in an object we use the name of the object paired with
        the name of the value we want to access. Using the same example, this is
        what that looks like:
      </p>

      <img
        src="/images/object-access-property.jpg"
        alt="A code snippet describinh how to acces the color property of the fruit object"
        class="image"
      />
      <p class="main-text">
        This will return the fruit color value that is store in the name/pair
        object.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        The biggest difference between an array and an object, is that an object
        can hold different values types within the one object. An array holds a
        list of values which are similar in type.

    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h2 class="title" id="functions">Functions! And why they are handy</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        A function is a set of instructions designed for a particular task.
        Functions are set to be executed whenever we call them to do so.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        A simple example of this is adding two numbers together. we can create a
        set of instructions that takes two numbers, adds them together and gives
        backs the answer.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">The example would look like this:</p>
      <img
        src="/images/function-addTwoNum.jpg"
        alt="A code snippet about a function that adds two numbers together"
        class="image"
      />
      <p class="main-text">
        Note that the (a, b) are parameters, a name that can store values in
        later, and give to our function to give us a result.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        The reason why functions functions are helpful is because we can create
        a set of instructions for a particular task, and then reuse them as many
        times as we want, and expect a specific result to be given back.
