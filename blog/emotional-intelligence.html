        To recognize, understand and manage our own emotions. To recognize,
        understand and influence the emotions of others. <br>Being aware that
        emotions can drive out behavior and impact people (positively and
        negatively) and learning how to manage those emotions - both our own and
        others - especially when we are under pressure.

      <p class="main-text">
        Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, perceive, and
        evaluate your emotions, and the emotions of others. It is the ability to
        be conscious of our emotions and how they can influence our everyday
        lives. One who has low emotional intelligence may let their emotions
        overtake their rational thinking, which could ultimately lead to
        negative results. One who had high emotional intelligence is able to
        understand their emotions, and the emotions of others, and use that
        knowledge to influence their rational thinking or decision making.

      <h3 class="question">How is it different to IQ?</h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        Your IQ refers to your intellectual ability - the ability to use logic
        to solve problems, to understand abstract ideas, to plan and strategize,
        to use language to convey ideas. If emotional intelligence is related to
        behavior, then intellectual ability relates to the information we use to
        make decisions. Everyone has an IQ

    <div class="section-card">
      <h3 class="question">Why is it important?</h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        If everyone made decisions based on facts and science, we would
        definitely get the same sets of answers or results. Science relies on
        what is and what isnâ€™t. The Boolean truth! Emotions add color. Emotions
        add another path, another layer when making decisions. Emotions is the
        brightly colored gray area between what we believe to be true and what
        the facts state is true. It is the reason we can leave everything we
        know behind for one person, or do the opposite, and hide ourselves away
        from the world. When the facts are placed in-front of us, it is our
        emotions that drive the final decision making process. The majority of
        the human race makes decisions on the way we feel. We
        <span class="bold-italics">feel</span> this is the best choice because
        of X, Y, Z. We <span class="bold-italics">believe</span> we are making
        the right choice based on X, Y, Z.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        If we can master our emotions, we can gain control over them, instead of
        our emotions controlling us. By improving our emotional intelligence, we
        can improve our understanding, and improve our power to influence
        others.
