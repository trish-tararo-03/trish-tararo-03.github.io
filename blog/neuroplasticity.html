        Did you ever go to the beach, play in the sand, and build a sandcastle,
        that had a few trenches for the water to flow around? Then you filled
        your bucket up full of sea water and ran back to your castle, and poured
        the water in the trenches. The feeling of satisfaction and joy when you
        witness your beautiful sandcastle, complete with a flowing water
        feature?
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        Neuroplasticity works in a similar way. The trenches are our neural
        pathways, and the water is the knowledge. More water = strenghtened
        pathways and retained knowledge. Without the water, the trenches dry up.

        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people.
      </h3>

      <p class="main-text">
        If your intention is to learn, or get better at a certain skill, such as
        learning an instrument, then having an understanding of the principals
        of neuroplasticity can definitely benefit the way you structure your
        approach to learning.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        At the beginning of the learning journey, you will pick up skills fast.
        You then need to repeat what you have learned in order to retain that
        information. There will be days where things get difficult, so focusing
        on areas where intensity can lead to deeper understanding is necessary.
        Over time, through consistent repetition, you will get better at your
        skill, and those neural pathways will have strengthened. Without that
        consistent practice over time, you will lose that skill or knowledge.
      </p>

      <h3 class="question">

      <p class="main-text">
        At the moment, I am learning Korean, so that I can watch K-Dramas and
        variety shows without English subtitles. I set aside 1 hour, usually
        before I sleep, to use a language learning app to study phrases,
        pronunciation and Hangul.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        Because of my need to watch K-dramas, without subtitles, I now have a
        specific reason to build, and strengthen those neural pathways,
        otherwise I’ll be watching subtitles for the rest of my life. To learn
        new phrases, you need practice and patience. Repetition is needed in
        order to not forget what you just learned. You need a challenge, like
        having a simple conversation with someone, in order to build intensity
        with the learning. Over time, I hope to be fluent enough to have
        conversations over K-BBQ and soju… The skill to learn one language can
        transfer into learning another language.

    <div class="section-card">
      <h3 class="question">
        What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
      </h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        I think, more than anything, you need to have a goal, a strong reason
        why you need to learn that skill. This will your driving force that will
        pull you through when it gets tough.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        Look for different types of experiences that are related to your goal.
        For example, in my journey of learning Korean, I could look for native
        speakers to practice with, watch short clips without subtitles and so
        on. The engagement itself is rewarding, and continuous repetition will
        make those pathways more permanent.

      <h2 class="title">Growth Mindset</h2>
      <h3 class="question">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        The Growth mindset simply refers to the belief that skills and
        intelligence can be improved upon through effort and persistence. With
        the growth mindset, there is no limit to your ability to grow and learn,
        even in failure.

      <h3 class="question">
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
      </h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        Doing this exploration on both neuroplasticity and developing a growth
        mindset helped me assess different areas of my life. I could see where I
        believed that I had a fixed mindset, and other areas where I believe I
        had a growth mindset.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-card">
      <h3 class="question">
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p class="main-text">
        I think for me, realizing that there is no need to put a cap on your
        learning ability, especially when it comes to areas where I feel a
        little out of my depth. Knowing what you know, and knowing what you
        don’t know, will greatly narrow down the learning scope. Before entering
        Dev Academy, the thought of JavaScript programming really terrified me.
        I think the time factor is what caused me to put a fixed mindset on my
        ability to learn. The thought that I had to quickly learn these concepts
        in order to carry out the tasks. I now know that learning is a process,
        not a race.

      <p class="main-text">I had already heard of the typical statements like “use it or lose it” and “repetition makes perfect” before, but I was never really aware of where they stem from. Learning about neuroplasticity has greatly affected how I will plan for future goals that I want to achieve and skills that I want to improve upon. Repetition, intensity will be the principals I will focus on incorporating into my learning plan.</p>
