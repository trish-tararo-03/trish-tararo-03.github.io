    <h3 class="question">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h3>
    <p class="main-text">In 2020, before the craziness of covid, I had been living in Melbourne for the past 4 years, working as a bartender/waiter in the hospitality industry. After visiting my parents and family over the christmas/new-years, I saw that the health of my parents wasn't in the best shape. I knew I had to leave Melbourne behind, so I could take care of my parents. In my heart, I knew it was the right thing to do. I knew I didn't have a choice. And yet, there was a small part of me that didn't want to let go. Looking back, I know it was because I didn't want to come back to NZ. Sometimes, the grass really is greener on the otherside. </p>

    <p class="main-text">So I had a month to pack up my life, and make the move back to NZ. I thought I had time to pack up my life, say goodbye to all the people that meant something to me, see the sights, all that. In that time, my fathers health did not improve. The day before I was set to fly back to NZ, I got the unfortunate news that my father had passed away from cancer in his liver. I was a wreck, a flurry of emotions flowing through me: sadness, rejection, heartbroken. On the plane ride, I felt guilty, for not wanting to leave Melbourne behind. I felt that I was selfish, and had wasted precious time, that could have been spent with my dad. I was pretty sad, and depressed for that year, lockdown was a blessing and a curse for me. </p>

    <p class="main-text">2 years later, I now know that it was okay to feel that way, we are only human beings with complicated emotions. That choice was a lesson for me to not take anything for granted, for we never know when our time is truly up.</p>
    
    <h3 class="question">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
    <p class="main-text">I am a New-Zealand born Cook-Island Maori woman, so I come from a culture that is family orientated. A culture that is expressed through our music, our clothing, our religious beliefs, our food. Where Sundays are spent having long brunches at your grandmothers house with your siblings. Where food is central to any family gathering. Where we are always willing to give, to help, in order to build and maintain the happiness of the family.</p> 

    <p class="main-text">Growing up in New Zealand also meant that I could explore the individual dynamic. Exposure to different situations that my parents never had growing up. A blending of cultures and and nationalities. Of skin tones. Of religious backgrounds.</p>
      
    <p class="main-text">Because of this, I think my core values are definitely a result of my cook-island culture and upbringing. Family, is important, it has given me love, trust, wisdom and respect AND I am obsessed with food!</p>
      
    <p class="main-text">My Identity, however, could be described as a mirror, a reflection of many things seen, different colors, faces, light rays, even different sizes. A combination of my cook-island upbringing, along with my kiwi experiences.</p>

      <h3 class="question">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>

      <p class="main-text">One of my strengths is to be adaptable to any situation. I feel that I am able to flow like water over any terrain, without giving it much thought. This shows that I am able to comprehend any situation, and have the confidence to test out different solutions in order to find the best answer. This also shows an ability to change direction, and find a new path.</p>
        
      <p class="main-text">Having compassion and empathy for others helps in social situations, where I can understand the reasons behind ones actions or words. Having the confidence to approach anyone and say hello is a skill I picked up while working as a bartender.</p>
        
      <p class="main-text">One of my limitations could be the lack of motivation to complete a task, or to seek a leadership role, out of fear of self doubt .</p>
        
      <p class="main-text">Another limitation, is the lack of planning, which leads to wasted time, or un-productive sessions.</p>

        <h3 class="question">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
        <p class="main-text">Being adaptable to any situation will definitely assist me in my learning journey. It means I will be able to look at any obstacle and test out different methods in order to overcome them. It also means that I will be able to change direction quickly if things don’t work out</p>

        <h3 class="question">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <p class="main-text">I think in my previous career as a bartender, you learn very quickly, that teamwork is important in order to survive a shift, especially when alcohol is involved. When you work in a busy bar on a Saturday night (pre-covid) resistance and tension from drunk customers is always there, although intensity levels differ throughout. When dealing with drunk people, having the support of your team is paramount. Knowing when to escalate an issue to management and security is the main strategy used. In the moment, it is in the best interest for the person to be removed form the premise. It was effective for the business and the staff, but I cannot say if it was effective for the patron.</p>

        <p class="main-text">Post-covid, with lengthy quarantines, I can say that this would still be the strategy used today. The difference now though, is that venues limit numbers, implement distancing rules and so on. Its a different time now, the vibe isn’t the same. I might have placed focus on non-alcoholic alternatives as a strategy to educate and inform people of their options in an effort to reduce the number of drunk cases.</p>
