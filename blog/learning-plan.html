        <h3 class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          I have always wanted a career that would allow me to be location free.
          A career where I could work with others to create something useful, or
          an experience that could change lives. A path that strays from the
          un-conventional. A career that gives back, one that my family can
          benefit from for generations. One that breaks the cycle. This is where
          Web Development comes into play, because it ticks all of those boxes.
          At the moment, I am enjoying the front-end side of Web development so
          I would like to progress in this area, perhaps learning the UX/UI
          design side also so I could be a design driven developer.

          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          I learn best by diving in and trying out different things to see what
          works. I am comfortable with receiving feedback and constructive
          critique. I am comfortable with failing. I can pick up on concepts
          quickly and apply them to a problem. Sometimes this approach can waste
          time as a lack of planning, or direction can result in time not spent
          productively, or time wasted obsessing over small details or going
          down rabbit holes on topics.

        </h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          I want to build a consistant habit to improve myself. To improve on my
          learning ability. To improve my communication skills with others. To
          be the one to reach out first. To build appreciation and grattitude
          for the little things, the big things. All the things. To crave that
          hunger, that drive that can propel my life in a new direction. As a
          legendary queen said: “If you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are
          you gonna love anybody else? Can I get an amen?!”

          representatives.

        <p class="main-text">
          I think, for myself to succeed, I may almost have to gamify my life. I
          need to make two checklists daily. One list should include the minimum
          amount of work or tasks that I would need to complete in order to not
          create stress for my future self. The other list should contain the
          minimum amount, plus the tasks that, if I were in peak condition,
          could also complete. This way, I will have a daily goal to complete.
          During foundations, scheduling time to work on your sprints, and
          really put in the work. I think that to work safely with others in
          this particular learning environment is to express thoughts and
          opinions freely and allow others that same courtesy to do the same.

          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to

        </h3>
        <p class="main-text">
          Realize that breaks are necessary for your brain to process
          information. Music is your best friend and a great way to change your
          mood. Go see friends who are not afraid to tell me the truth and get a
          reality check. A glass of wine and a charcuterie board is always a
          great time.

          If it is a technical problem that I cannot solve using google, make
          use of the discord channel. I have found great success with using this
          avenue so far. We are lucky to have great facilitators who are always
          around to offer support. I have a good support system in my mum and
          other key family members that always bring me back to earth for mental
          and emotional support. I also have dear friends who respect me and
          challenge my way of thinking.

        <p class="main-text">
          I just want to know and feel that their support is there when I need
          it most. To have a channel of communication between facilitator and
          student, where I can feel safe and express concerns, worries without
          judgement. To get constructive feedback about growth.

          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are

          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

          I am a caregiver for my mother, so any appointments relating to her
          health is of high importance to me. I have taken this into
          consideration in relation to bootcamp.
