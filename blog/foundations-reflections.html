    <h2 class="subtitle">Reflecting on my foundations journey</h2>

    <div class="section-card">
     <h3 class="question">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
       <ul class="list">
      <li class="bulletpoints">I enjoy meditation, and have found it to be beneficial since I have stared practicing. It is really helpful when I am going to sleep.</li>
      <li class="bulletpoints">I have a fixed mindset when it comes to JavaScript coding. </li>
      <li class="bulletpoints">My ego takes a backseat to my critical voice.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
     <h3 class="question">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
     <p class="main-text">I think each of these roles are important in developing the human mind. Values help define our moral compass and ethical standards. We use these values to determine our style of learning. I think empathy defines how we can relate to other people. Learning can be a solo journey, but I find it is improved when you learn with others. Programming is a collaborative job and lifestyle. A programmer reviews code written by others, gives feedback and offers advice. Without empathy, the communication can seem like harsh critique that does not promote growth. Being self aware of your mental and physical state can greatly affect your learning and programming ability. If you are aware that your mental and physical states are low, you can use different methods to fix this. If you are unaware, you are still able to fix yourself, but this process could bring about more stress for yourself.</p>

    <div class="section-card">
     <h3 class="question">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
     <p class="main-text">What has surprised me is how I could shift my mindset to build a habit once they have acquired knowledge. I really enjoyed learning about neuroplasticity and building a growth mindset. I learned that I had a fixed mindset about JavaScript programming. I believed that I had reached the limit of my learning capabilities in this area. Carol Dweck states otherwise. By believing that, although one does not have all the answers right now, one is capable of  acquiring the means to get the answer, we have developed a growth mindset. Through this learning, JavaScript coding has been a more enjoyable learning experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
     <h3 class="question">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
     <p class="main-text">Learning about myself though these deep-dives and reflecting on the past 10 years. There are things that I want to improve about myself, doing the core learning helped make those areas blaringly obvious.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
     <h3 class="question">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
     <p class="main-text">I think its because we are not robots that code. We are humans, who all have strengths and limitations and emotions. It is important to learn about what drives the human mind to make decisions. What forces are at play that influence our behavior. Can we influence our own behavior by changing our thinking? Understanding our mental state of mind will help with bringing our strengths to the table in other areas of our lives like communication and teamwork.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
     <h3 class="question">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
     <p class="main-text">I think it was a great learning experience. I wanted to study at Dev Academy because I had heard it wasnâ€™t just about learning code. Now having gone through foundations, I feel like I am improving not only as a developer, but as a human being. Using different skills I have learned in these core deep dives will be of great help in different areas of my life. It will make me better programmer and developer. It will make me a better person.</p>
